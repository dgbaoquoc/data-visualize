                            <p>Donald Trump has transformed as a result of his Internet presence. In 2016, he was the
                                internet's candidate—listed he's in the Urban Dictionary's definition of meme god—and
                                his campaign used Facebook advertising to defeat Hillary Clinton. Since then, he's
                                gotten even more concerned with small complaints and conspiracy theories that play well
                                on Twitter, which is utilized by just 22% of the population in the United States.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Trump has also had a noticeable impact on the internet. During President Trump's first
                                term, Americans saw his administration savor the chance to repeal net neutrality, the
                                foundational concept of free and open internet. “Mr. President”, on the other hand, has
                                had a far greater influence on the internet than the strangest memes or the longest
                                Twitter feuds. His administration has altered how Americans connect with one another
                                online, amplifying the tone of division and distrust, molding conventions and standards,
                                and instilling the expectation that each day online will be stranger than the last.

                                Vic Berger, a Vine artist, created creepy six-second films during the 2016 presidential
                                primary season, exposing Republican hopefuls as ludicrous. He'd focus on the moments
                                when they appeared to be the most genuine versions of themselves: Jeb Bush was a
                                tormented husk of a failed politician who knew words but not human face emotions. Trump
                                kept repeating statements and making strange physical motions, such as pointing with his
                                thumbs at individuals. There were a lot of air horns on the scene. The New Yorker dubbed
                                Berger a "political satirist for the internet election" after millions of people viewed
                                each tape and expressed their delight in the comments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Trump has indirectly promoted such conduct and has occasionally gladly engaged in the
                                worst of meme culture. Memes helped him win in 2016, and now other politicians are
                                expected to follow suit: Memes are just another type of political advertisement that can
                                be bought. Michael Bloomberg's team spent a lot of money on advertising on prominent
                                meme accounts when he ran for the Democratic nomination this year, claiming the need to
                                "meet people where they are and fight with President Trump's tremendous digital
                                operation."

                            <p>
                                Trump’s personality is certainly extreme by any standard, and particularly rare for a
                                presidential candidate; many people who encounter the man—in negotiations or in
                                interviews or on a debate stage or watching that debate on television—seem to find him
                                flummoxing.
                            </p>

                                Anger, along with a sense of humor, is at the core of Trump's appeal:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When people with authoritarian tendencies think that their way of life is being
                                endangered, they may gravitate to strong leaders like Donald Trump who vow to protect
                                them. High degrees of authoritarianism appeared as the single biggest predictor of
                                expressing political support for Donald Trump in a recent nationwide poll conducted by
                                political scientist Matthew MacWilliams. Trump's pledge to build a wall on the Mexican
                                border to keep illegal immigrants out, as well as his rhetoric against Muslims and other
                                foreigners, are likely to have exacerbated the situation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Trump plays to an old fear of contagion, which compares out-groups to parasites,
                                poisons, and other contaminants, as highlighted by social scientist Jesse Graham. In
                                this aspect, Trump's fear of germs and aversion to body fluids, particularly women's, is
                                possibly no psychological coincidence. He famously said that Fox News host Megyn Kelly
                                had "blood running out of her everywhere," and he called Hillary Clinton's restroom
                                break during a Democratic debate "disgusting." Impurity elicits a basic sense of
                                disgust. Trump appears to experience more disgust on a daily basis, or at least claims
                                to, than the majority of people.

                                Other presidents have a habit of speaking in a highly "politician's voice" in public.
                                However, Donald Trump prefers to engage with the public in a dusty manner, which has
                                also astonished a great number of foreign observers. We usually see him on Twitter with
                                criticism on most of the events.
                            </p>

                                Everyone is suspicious of... anything now because of Trump.

                                Alternative facts had not yet been coined in the United States four years ago. They
                                hadn't yet elected a president who would continuously rail against "fake news" and the
                                "lamestream media" outlets that spread it. They hadn't yet come across a lifestyle
                                influencer who said, "Do your own research" when discussing a pandemic that was a fake.
                                They hadn't seen a president fail to denounce a violent conspiracy community that claims
                                the Democratic Party is involved in child trafficking and Satanic rituals.
                            </p>

                                According to Renee Hobbs, a communication professor at the University of Rhode Island,
                                Trump is the "poster child" of false information. “He doesn't respect specialists of
                                proof; instead, he trusts his instincts, and he displays the attraction of that.” He
                                smears the media, promotes conspiracy theories, and lies about fundamental facts.
                                However, Trump's anti-truth stance has backfired in several respects.“Fake news” has
                                been “good for the conversation” in general. Even though many of them are spouting it
                                about aimlessly, the catchphrase has made more people aware of the need for media
                                literacy.

                                After our “meme god’, Donald Trump got his administration downgraded. Twitter has
                                officially banned his account stand bt @realDonaldTrump with 88 million followers due to
                                the danger of additional incitement of violence following a thorough examination of
                                recent Tweets from the account and the context around them — specifically, how they are
                                being received and perceived on and off Twitter.
                            </p>

                                Twitter has taken action against the president's account for the second time in a week.
                                Following a violent protest at the Capitol, Twitter erased three tweets that pushed
                                conspiracy theories about the election and froze Trump's account on Wednesday, claiming
                                "a danger of violence". Trump's official @POTUS account is still online, but if Twitter
                                believes he's using it to circumvent the ban, it will take steps to limit its usage,
                                according to a Twitter representative.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's the end of a meme. This will undoubtedly be etched in our minds.
